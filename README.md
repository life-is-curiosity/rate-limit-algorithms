<p>In the development of the high availability system, we usually protect the system by different kinds of ways, such as Cache, Rate Limit, and Downgrade. And this topic will be talking about the Rate Limit. The purpose of the Rate Limit is to prevent the system not to be destroyed by large amounts of requests to the system in a short period.</p>
